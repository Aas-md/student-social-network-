# Social-app-for-student

An android application designed to help students by sharing their information like pdf files,important images,links etc ! This is a Social media kind of service which shares the information among the students so that they can be aware


This project was build during my winter vocations 2022! we have planed to use separate app instead of whatsApp or telegram groups since these are very limited and generally the students do not have awareness and access to the college groups!  in this i have used cloud Firestore and Firebase Storage  as a backend  for this app and in this i use google authentication thus user can signIn in a single button click Whenever a post is created by a user will be visible to all the user related to the app of a particular college !Hence providing help and making more aware to students
